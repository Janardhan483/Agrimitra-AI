## 📌 Problem Statement

Farmers in India face increasing uncertainty from:
* **Changing Weather Patterns & Climate Volatility:** Cyclones, unseasonal rains during harvest, terminal heatwaves, and erratic monsoons.
* **Traditional Monoculture Trap:** Many farmers continue repetitive planting of water-guzzling crops because they lack localized information on viable, profitable alternatives.
* **Input Availability & Resource Squeeze:** Rising fertilizer/seed costs and depleting groundwater tables.
* **Opaque Market Demand & Asymmetric Pricing:** Farmers sell to the nearest local middleman or sub-mandi at distress prices, unaware of where actual demand exists in neighboring or regional terminal markets.

---

## 💡 The AgriMitra AI Solution

**AgriMitra AI** is an intelligent decision-support platform designed to bring **climate**, **crop**, **market**, and **agricultural-input** information together into a unified, actionable, and voice-enabled interface.

It empowers smallholders and progressive farmers to make data-backed decisions on:
1. **What to grow:** Based on soil type, water availability, and climate-resilient alternative crops (e.g. Millets/Shree Anna, Pulses, Oilseeds).
2. **When to grow:** Localized sowing and harvest window calendars with agrometeorological projections.
3. **Climate risks:** Early warning alerts for unseasonal rainfall, heat stress, frost, and fungal disease outbreaks.
4. **Where demand exists:** Real-time APMC mandi tracking with official MSP comparison and distance-based freight profit calculators.
5. **How to maximize net payout:** Logistics arbitrage engine showing extra net income from selling in regional high-demand terminal markets.
